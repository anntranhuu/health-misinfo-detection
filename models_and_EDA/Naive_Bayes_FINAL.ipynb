            "  \"text\": \"Adding small amounts of powdered ginger to food may help take the edge off seasonal allergy symptoms, according to an animal study published online in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry. Daily intake of dried ginger significantly reduced sneezing and other signs of allergy in rodents with induced allergic rhinitis, or hay fever.\\n\\nA major component in ginger, 6-gingerol, suppresses the activation of T lymphocytes, or T cells, a type of white blood cell that plays an important role in sensitizing people to specific allergens, the researchers said.\\n\\nGinger is a popular spice produced from the root of the ginger plant, Zingiber officinale. Some herbal remedies for nausea and other ailments also contain ginger.\\n\\nExperiments in Japan involved mice fed a normal diet containing 2% powdered ginger or a control diet without ginger. After two weeks on the diets, the ginger-fed mice received two injections of purified egg proteins called ovalbumin (OVA) to stimulate allergic rhinitis symptoms. Control mice received either OVA or placebo injections.\\n\\nThe mice underwent an immune challenge two weeks later in which a small amount of OVA was inserted into the nose. Allergic symptoms, such as sneezing and nasal rubbing, were counted for the next 10 minutes.\\n\\nMice in the ginger-fed group sneezed 2.1 times each, on average. This compares with 15.2 sneezes per mouse in the OVA-injected controls and roughly one sneeze in the placebo-injected animals. Fewer nasal rubbing movements were recorded in the ginger-fed mice compared with OVA-injected controls, but not the placebo group.\\n\\nGinger-fed mice had lower levels of immunoglobulin E, or IgE, a type of allergic antibody, and mast cells, which release chemicals called histamines that cause sneezing and other allergic symptoms, the study showed. T cells stimulate the production of IgE to specific allergens. IgE binds to receptors on mast cells, triggering the release of histamine.\\n\\nThe study used powdered ginger, the type used in cooking, containing 0.5% 6-gingerol. Previous studies suggest powdered ginger contains higher concentrations of 6-gingerol than fresh ginger, researchers said.\\n\\nCaveat: The antiallergic effects of ginger may vary with the 6-gingerol content, researchers said. Ginger has not been tested on people with allergic rhinitis.\\n\\nPrevention of allergic rhinitis by ginger and the molecular basis of immunosuppression by 6-gingerol through T cell inactivation\",\n",

The researchers haven’t even recruited study participants yet, much less conducted the study or analyzed the results. The story also fails to describe how potential diagnosis might work, what the technique may cost, or what risks are involved. It’s also not clear whether any of the researchers have a potential conflict of interest. In short, the story raises far more questions than it answers. That’s problematic.\\n\\xa0', 'img': 'https://www.healthnewsreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GettyImages-973719052-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.healthnewsreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GettyImages-973719052.jpg 724w', 'Why This Matters': 'Alzheimer’s disease affects around 5 million Americans — and that number is expected to double by 2060. The disease adversely affects the quality of life for both patients and their loved ones, and it is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. In short, Alzheimer’s disease is a big deal, and any new advances in risk assessment or diagnosis are newsworthy.\\nHowever, because this is a subject that many people are passionate about, it is especially important to approach new research responsibly. In this instance, the study has not even taken place yet, and the story fails to answer most of the major questions one might have regarding Alzheimer’s research.\\nWe can understand that a research institution may want to raise awareness of a forthcoming study in order to recruit study participants. We are less clear on why a major news outlet would write about the research — which hasn’t even taken place yet — as if it is already newsworthy and generating data that clinical decisions can be based upon.'}, 'criteria': [{'question': 'Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?', 'answer': 'Not Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'Cost is not discussed. And there are multiple costs to consider here: the cost of the virtual reality (VR) hardware itself, the cost of whatever software the study participants would be using, and the cost of training professionals to interpret the data generated by study participants using the virtual reality technology. (Note: we say “study participants” because there are no patients yet, but — ultimately — the cost to patients is what we’d be interested in.)'}, {'question': 'Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?', 'answer': 'Not Applicable', 'explanation': 'This is tricky. The study has not yet taken place, so there are no benefits to discuss — which makes it difficult to ding the story for failing to quantify the benefits. As such, we’ll rate this as not applicable. However, our reasons for rating it N/A highlight a critical problem with the story, which we address in Quality of Evidence and Availability, below.'}, {'question': 'Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?', 'answer': 'Not Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'The big risk here, as with any screening test, is incorrect results. Even if the study hasn’t happened yet, and important data sets like sensitivity and specificity can’t yet be quantified, they should be addressed in the story. What are sensitivity and specificity? Sensitivity measures how often a test correctly generates a positive result for people who have the condition that’s being tested for. Specificity measures a test’s ability to correctly generate a negative result for people who don’t have the condition that’s being tested for. In other words, there are two possible harms inherent in diagnostic and risk assessment tools: the failure to identify someone who has Alzheimer’s; and the “false positive” misdiagnosis of people who do not have Alzheimer’s. Either mistake can have significant costs — financial and personal — for patients.'}, {'question': 'Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? ', 'answer': 'Not Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'The story offers a rough overview of the size of the forthcoming study. But it fails to address key points about the study. How will the study assess a patient’s navigation skills (which the point of using a VR device)? How will it distinguish between people whose navigation skills are poor because of early neural degeneration, versus people who have never been good at navigating? Is this a longitudinal study, with patients participating in the study over the course of years, coupled with long-term follow-up to determine if and when patients develop Alzheimer’s or other, related conditions? Those are all good questions, and they are not answered here.'}, {'question': 'Does the story commit disease-mongering?', 'answer': 'Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'No disease mongering here.'}, {'question': 'Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?', 'answer': 'Not Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'The story notes that the forthcoming study has received funding from the Alzheimer’s Society. However, the only source cited in the story is one of the researchers who will be conducting the study. Input from an independent expert about the viability of such a study would have been very welcome.'}, {'question': 'Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?', 'answer': 'Not Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'There is no discussion of other approaches that are used to identify people who have Alzheimer’s disease among high-risk groups. There is also no acknowledgement of the fact that there is no definitive way to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease in patients while they are still alive (the only definitive diagnostic technique involves an autopsy). That’s a heck of an oversight.'}, {'question': 'Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?', 'answer': 'Not Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'On the one hand, the story does tell readers that there will be a forthcoming study to evaluate whether VR technology can be used to test people’s navigation ability in order to determine whether it is an effective technique for diagnosing Alzheimer’s. (In other words, they don’t even know if this is something that will work yet.)\\nOn the other hand, earlier in the story, readers run across sentences like: “Virtual reality to help detect early risk of Alzheimer’s” and “Those who do worse in the tests will be the ones most likely to succumb to Alzheimer’s later in life, scientists now believe.” That makes it sound like this is already a useful tool, and availability could be right around the corner. Ultimately, the story never explicitly tells readers that any possible VR tool is years away, at best. That tips the scales for us, and we lean in the direction of “not satisfactory” on this criterion. One wonders how many people read this story and contacted their general practitioner about taking a VR test to assess their Alzheimer’s risk.'}, {'question': 'Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?', 'answer': 'Not Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'The story does note that previous work has been done determining that navigational skills are an early indicator of Alzheimer’s risk. However, the story makes it seem like the use of VR technology is what’s new here. That’s not true. We found studies using VR to assess issues related to navigation ability and Alzheimer’s dating back to at least 2008 and 2009. So, what sets the forthcoming study apart? We wish the story had made that clear.'}, {'question': 'Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?', 'answer': 'Not Applicable', 'explanation': 'We couldn’t find a related news release, so we’ll rate this N/A.'}], 'news_source': 'The Guardian'}, {'link': 'https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/in-story-on-experimental-contraceptive-gel-reuters-lets-drug-company-control-the-narrative/', 'title': 'In story on experimental contraceptive gel, Reuters lets drug company control the narrative', 'description': 'This leaves both investors and lay audiences without enough information to evaluate how useful the new product will be, should it pass muster with the FDA.', 'original_title': \"Evofem's birth control gel meets main study goal; shares rise\", 'news_id': 'story_reviews_00001', 'rating': 3, 'reviewers': ['Jill U.

But researchers only studied the gel for seven menstrual cycles.\\nThe story compares this pregnancy rate to a couple of of other forms of birth control, which is good, but it’s worth pointing out that those failure rates have far more evidence behind them.

However, this story quotes the CEO of the product’s maker, as well as two business analysts.'}, {'question': 'Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?', 'answer': 'Not Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'The story mentions other birth control products, such as male condoms and birth control pills.\\nHowever, the story sharply misleads readers by claiming that the positive results with the gel brings: “the first hormone-free contraceptive close to approval.” That’s simply wrong. Current hormone-free products include male condoms, copper IUDs, diaphragms, and cervical caps.'}, {'question': 'Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?', 'answer': 'Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'The story makes clear that this a product under development, not yet approved or marketed.'}, {'question': 'Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?', 'answer': 'Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'The story describes how the new product differs from male condoms — “woman-controlled” — and how it differs from oral pills — “non-hormonal.” But this isn’t novel, as we describe in alternatives.\\nAlthough testing is still underway, as the story notes, what’s interesting is that the gel may have some effectiveness against some sexually transmitted diseases, which would make it different from most other forms of female-based contraceptives.

This study looked at the effects of one bisphosphonate — Reclast — in women with osteopenia, which is believed to be a much larger population.\\nNew stories about studies that might encourage wider use of any medication should include ample information about potential benefits and harms. In this case, bisphosphonates have a fraught history that should inform news coverage.\\nAs this NPR article from 2009 explains, the diagnosis of osteopenia was created in 1992 to describe women with thinning bones based on a scan.

But this story about the results of a trial of a prescription drug derived from fish oil (brand name Vascepa) relies on a news release and company statements that don’t provide basic information about the precise number or type of cardiovascular events observed by researchers.

It is also premature to claim that the results represent “heart-medicine history,” especially given that the findings haven’t been peer-reviewed and are at odds with numerous previous studies.\\nThe story takes a cheerleading tone and fails to supply key context. For example, it highlights a dramatic quote from a researcher without noting that he was paid over $120,000 by the drug company, including payments for speeches and other appearances on its behalf, in 2017. The story headline and text do make clear that only patients with cardiovascular disease and high levels of triglycerides or diabetes were in the trial, so it should be clear to readers that this drug was not shown to prevent disease in healthy people. The story does not give any details about potential harms of the drug.

Based on what little we know, it is possible that the 25% reduction was driven mainly by a lower rate of hospitalizations for chest pain — an outcome that’s less important and also more subject to bias on the part of investigators who decide which patients get hospitalized and which ones don’t.

It carries a powerful emotional punch and an apparently happy ending that overwhelms the evidence presented. Numerous psychology studies document the power of “outcome bias,” in which the results of a\\xa0decision affect beliefs about whether the decision was correct or not. We are very happy that all went well, but it is reasonable to assume this story would have looked very different if had not.\\nThere is no mention of the costs of the surgical procedure. Neither is carotid stenting mentioned as an alternative to endarterectomy surgery. Discussion of carotid artery screening of people who do not have symptoms is mixed up with the reporter’s experience with testing done in order to diagnose the cause of symptoms – a somewhat common flaw of conflating diagnostic testing with screening tests. The risk that the surgery could trigger a stroke, including a fatal one, is highlighted, but the risk statistics reported here are lower than those published in major summaries of the evidence.\\n\\xa0', 'img': 'https://www.healthnewsreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/iStock_000086219239_Small-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.healthnewsreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/iStock_000086219239_Small.jpg 849w', 'Why This Matters': 'The headline of the story proclaims that a carotid artery scan “Saved My Life.” That may be true, but it is also unknowable. What the best summaries of the evidence conclude is that in cases similar to those of the reporter, surgery to clear a nearly-blocked carotid artery lowers the long-term risk of stroke and death. However, stories on this topic should highlight the fact that the procedure does not actually “save the lives” of most patients. As a systematic review of the evidence by the Cochrane Collaboration concluded, using a statistical analysis known as the number needed to treat (NNT), six patients need to be treated to prevent one stroke or death within five years of the surgery. That means that for five out of six patients, the procedure probably does not alter the outcome: Either they would not have had a stroke or died even without surgery or they still had a stroke or died despite having the surgery.\\nAnother important concern with this story is that the reporter uses his own case — where the scan was part of an attempt to track down the cause of his neurological symptoms — to argue for scanning of all older adults, including those who have no symptoms at all. This is a misleading argument since people with blockage severe enough to cause symptoms are likely different in important ways (and more likely to benefit from this scan) than those who don’t display symptoms. While it is certainly reasonable to choose a treatment shown to reduce the risk of stroke and death, it is imperative that stories clearly communicate the difference between screening and diagnosis, and the uncertainty about whether any particular patient will benefit.'}, 'criteria': [{'question': 'Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?', 'answer': 'Not Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'While the story reports the cost of scanning carotid arteries to be about $70, it does not discuss the cost of surgery. One analysis of Medicare reimbursements done a few years ago reported hospitals were paid about $11,000 for each patient getting a carotid endarterectomy. An earlier report estimated that in 2008 hospitals charged about $35,000 for the surgery and associated treatment, though the ultimate reimbursements by Medicare were much lower.'}, {'question': 'Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?', 'answer': 'Not Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'The story does report on the results of a major trial from 20 years ago that concluded patients who were randomized to surgery had about a 5 percent risk of stroke or death within three years, “less than half that of people treated only with drugs.” But this statistic is overwhelmed by the headline (The Scan that Saved My Life) and the punchline, “mostly I feel lucky to have gotten a test that may have saved my life.”\\nA more recent review of the evidence by the international Cochrane Collaboration concludes that the “number needed to treat‘ (for the type of blockage and symptoms the reporter had) would be six patients. Meaning, six people have to be treated to prevent one stroke or death over a five-year period. In other words, the surgery likely does not alter the outcomes of five out of six patients. Either they wouldn’t have had a stroke or died even without treatment or they did have a stroke or died despite undergoing surgery.'}, {'question': 'Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?', 'answer': 'Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'We will rate the story as satisfactory because it does clearly point out that the surgery is hazardous, sometimes triggering a stroke, and that some patients die soon after the procedure. However, the story reports stroke and death rates at the lower end of the ranges reported in medical literature. The story says a major task force report estimated the risk of stroke and death within 30 days after surgery as less than 3 percent overall, but up to 5 percent at some hospitals. However, the lower figure in that task force report uses data only from clinical trials, which typically involve highly skilled surgeons and have better outcomes than typical clinical care. That report also said that some observational data indicates a risk of stroke and death of almost 7 percent at some hospitals. The evidence review mentioned above concludes that the 30-day risk of stroke and death is 7 percent in clinical trials of carotid endarterectomy.\\nThe story does warn readers that few hospitals and surgeons publish their individual results.\\nThe story would have been stronger had it mentioned that there are harms that can occur if we started screening anyone, regardless of whether they had symptoms. As the USPSTF explains, “For the general primary care population, the magnitude of benefit is small to none. Adequate evidence indicates that both the testing strategy for carotid artery stenosis and treatment with [surgery or stenting] can cause serious harms.”'}, {'question': 'Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence?

However, the story seems to cherry-pick conclusions, favoring those that tilt toward screening and treatment while questioning those that recommend against widespread screening. It features a guideline in favor of screening from a professional society of surgeons. It does not mention the evidence review by the international Cochrane Collaboration. It also does not mention important limitations of studies that appear to favor screening — including that the medical therapy used in some of these older studies is no longer considered state of the art.

Yet\\xa0risk for repeated suicidal behavior is greatest during the first 6 months following a suicidal crisis.

Genentech has provided no evidence that baloxavir marboxil is this drug.\\nThere is a lot of money to be made off a drug that can treat the flu effectively. The new drug, baloxavir marboxil, was not better than Tamiflu at reducing flu symptoms, according to data Genentech included in its news release about the FDA’s decision to grant priority review. And like Tamiflu, it has to be taken within 48 hours of flu symptoms developing. The difference is that baloxavir marboxil is a single dose, one-time treatment, whereas Tamiflu must be taken twice a day, for five days. The release also hints at the idea that the drug made people less infectious, but there is no evidence that those who took baloxavir marboxil infected fewer people than those who were on the placebo or on Tamiflu.\\nMoreover, all this ignores the bigger question: When it comes to the flu, what does “effective” mean?

No absolute numbers are given, so it’s impossible to know how many of the patients in each arm actually benefited and to what extent. All it provides is the relative improvement in “response” to medication: “researchers found a 30% greater response to the medicine when the test was applied.” No data is provided for remission.\\nBut when you look at the raw numbers regarding remission rates, and compare the results of both groups, they don’t look as impressive: Of those who didn’t receive genetic testing, 10% reached remission. With the tests, it was 15%. This gives the reader perspective that the absolute difference was 5%.\\nAlso, the news release hints that at least some of the results might not have been statistically significant, and we’re curious about that and think it should have been explained in the story:\\n“The GeneSight-treated cohort also demonstrated higher symptom improvement which approached statistical significance (Chart 1).”'}, {'question': 'Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?', 'answer': 'Not Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'The test itself — using DNA taken from a cheek swab — carries no physical risks.\\nBut the story needed more detail about the potential downsides.

So, a person is told to take certain drugs not because they’ll be more effective than other drugs, they’re just less likely to cause problems.\\nCould selecting drugs based on how many problems they cause lead some people to choose drugs that aren’t as effective for treating depression? That would seem to be biggest issue in terms of harms — that the test would simply be wrong for some people.\\nAlso, the test appears to show results for drugs beyond antidepressants — including some drugs that are known to cause dependency or can be deadly when taken alone, mixed together or with other drugs, such as hypnotics and benzodiazepines (Ambien and Xanax, for example).

That sounds like a great benefit, and many desperate people might be tempted to use kratom based on such claims — and without sufficient understanding of the potential downsides. But as this well-reported story points out, the purported benefits of kratom are not based on sound science and are often promoted by those with a commercial interest in the product.\\nThe story did touch upon a complicated back story here, too — the involvement of Big Pharma in the opioid epidemic. Some pharmaceutical companies have admitted to overselling the benefits and underselling harms of opioids. That understandably makes many of us leery of their claims and their stance on kratom.

The development of a “male pill” would allow men to share responsibility for family-planning purposes and would allow couples to take advantage of “the pill” even if the woman is not comfortable taking a pill herself.\\nIn short, a male pill could have significant ramifications in regard to quality of life for many people. However, the idea of a male pill has also been around for decades, with claims of breakthroughs in the field dating back almost 40 years. Nonetheless, a safe, effective male birth control pill has yet to make it to the marketplace. This story does a good job of describing the latest study in a long line of related research — but fails to place it in the context of that long line of research. That context is valuable for understanding what makes this latest research novel. In addition, it’s not clear when (if ever) this technology may be available to consumers.'}, 'criteria': [{'question': 'Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?', 'answer': 'Not Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'Cost is not discussed.

Preliminary clinical trials, like this one, are primarily aimed at determining whether a given medical treatment is safe. That said, if a story is focused on the development of a male birth control pill, presumably the story needs to address the extent to which the pill may actually work. The story notes that “the once-daily prototype pill suppressed certain hormones to the low levels you’d expect to see with effective longer-term contraceptives.” What does that mean? The story later mentions “testosterone and two [other] hormones needed for the production of sperm.” Which hormones are we talking about? How low would the levels have to be? How low were the levels found in the study? And to what extent do those lower hormone levels reduce or eliminate sperm count?\\nAnd most importantly, the story carried no caveat that the pregnancy rate is still unknown. If it actually works as a contraceptive remains to be seen.'}, {'question': 'Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?', 'answer': 'Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'The story notes the range of side effects found among study participants, though some of the characterizations appear to lack context. For example, the story mentions that some subjects experienced “mild weight gain.” Based on information in the study abstract, the mean weight gain was 1.5 to 3.9 kilograms. Given that 3.9 kilograms is 8.5 pounds, that’s not inconsiderable. i.e., many men may balk at the idea of gaining more than eight pounds in a month. It’s also not clear what sort of weight we’re talking about. Muscle? Fat? Water retention? This may be particularly relevant (and worth articulating clearly) for a medical intervention aimed specifically at sexually active adults.\\nBy the same token, the story notes that “a minority of participants did experience decreased libido during the study.” According to the study abstract, eight of the study participants who received the drug experienced decreased libido. Given that only 83 people completed the study, and that some of those study participants received a placebo, that means that more than 10 percent of men who received the drug experienced decreased libido.\\nAgain, this seems particularly relevant for a drug aimed solely at people who are planning to have sex. In short, the story did not overlook any of the potential harms discussed in the abstract, but could have done a better job of placing those potential harms in relevant context. How appealing is a birth control pill for men if it makes more than 10 percent of them less interested in sex in the first place?'}, {'question': 'Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence?

It also isn’t all that clear what exactly is being done in terms of the procedure itself. This is common with such early presentations at a meeting where the researcher only gets a short time to describe the findings, and that raises the importance of waiting for a full publication of results with more patients and longer term follow-up.

In other words, breast cancer is something that many women worry about. Meanwhile, tests for mutations in the BRCA genes that can pose an increased risk of breast cancer have garnered widespread media coverage in recent years, thanks (at least in part) to Angelina Jolie’s highly-publicized decision to have a double mastectomy after testing positive for relevant mutations.\\nGenetic testing is much more complicated and nuanced than getting a cholesterol level. Proper education and counseling by a physician with experience in cancer genetics and/or a genetic counselor is essential when deciding whether or not to be tested. It’s also important when deciding what test to perform, and for assistance in understanding the significance and implications of positive, negative or indeterminate test results.\\nIn this instance, the story doesn’t convey that complexity or offer much information that readers can use to make decisions about the use of the recently-approved 23andMe test.

While this is a significant out-of-pocket expense for most people, it is somewhat less expensive than some other genetic testing options. However, those other testing options are significantly more extensive. In other words, as one genetic counselor notes in a related article in The Atlantic, “[23andMe] is not an inexpensive way to get your testing done more cheaply.”'}, {'question': 'Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?', 'answer': 'Not Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'The benefits in this context would, presumably, be an increased awareness of one’s risk for breast cancer; information that can be used to make informed decisions about monitoring and prevention. However, the story does not use numbers in a way that would help women choose the best course of action. For example, it does not explain how accurate the test is, nor does it tell readers how much their cancer risk is increased with a positive result. It also does not explain what women might do to mitigate that increased risk, and how much their risk would decrease as a result.\\nWhile it might be too much to ask the story to include all of this information, providing at least some of these numbers would be necessary to meet our expectations for this criterion.'}, {'question': 'Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?', 'answer': 'Not Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'There are questions about accuracy that will be discussed under quality of evidence, but we think it’s worth addressing potential harm associated with any screening test: false results. The Mayo Clinic notes that testing positive for a BRCA mutation can cause “Feelings of anxiety, anger, sadness or depression”; “Difficult decisions about preventive measures that have long-term consequences”; and “Feelings of inevitability that you’ll get cancer.” Those are serious stresses associated with accurate diagnoses. Those same stresses can occur if someone is inaccurately told that they have a relevant gene mutation — and that’s a potential harm that is worth mentioning.\\nAnother potential harm is if a patient is found to have a “VUS” – variant of uncertain significance. This is an abnormality in the gene which may or may not be harmful. When patients undergo genetic testing under the care of their physician or genetic counselor, the possibility and implications of a VUS are explained prior to and after testing. As the 23andMe testing kit is available to the consumer without a prescription and without a requirement for pre-test education or counseling, patients may be further confused if the results reveal a VUS.'}, {'question': 'Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? ', 'answer': 'Not Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'There is no discussion of the medical evidence behind this test. How well-tested it is? How much science supports it use? What kind of evidence is required for FDA approval?\\nLet’s also talk about accuracy itself. In any medical test there are two types of accuracy: sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity refers to how accurate the test is at detecting a problem in people who have that problem. Specificity refers to how accurate the test is at determining there is no problem. And these things tend to be a bit of a trade-off. i.e., tests with a high sensitivity have a low false-negative rate, but are likely to have a higher rate of false positives; whereas tests with a high specificity have a low false-positive rate, but are likely to have a higher rate of false negatives.\\nWhat are the sensitivity and specificity for the 23andMe tests discussed in this story? The story doesn’t tell us. That said, the story does get credit for noting that the 23andMe test only tests for “three out of more than 1,000 known BRCA mutations” — and that those three mutations are found predominantly in people of Eastern European Jewish descent. That’s valuable context for highlighting the limitations of the testing.'}, {'question': 'Does the story commit disease-mongering?', 'answer': 'Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'No disease mongering here.'}, {'question': 'Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?', 'answer': 'Not Satisfactory', 'explanation': 'The story provides useful information from an FDA news release and clearly notes that the relevant testing is a test being marketed by a specific company.

What is less clear is whether these differences are due to beneficial changes caused by the text messages or other factors. For example, in a\\u00a0subsequent letter to the journal, a researcher notes that the differences in blood pressure between the two groups were due mainly to 7-point increase in the control group, whereas the text message group\\u2019s blood pressure stayed about the same over the course of the study. Similarly, the BMI differences between the groups were due partly to an increase in BMI in the control group and weren\\u2019t entirely due to reductions in the text message group. The story communicates the study results accurately and doesn\\u2019t suggest that the text messages lowered CVD risk factors from baseline.

For men at high risk for the disease -- blacks and men who have a father, brother or son found to have prostate cancer at an early age (before 65) -- that discussion should start at age 45.\\n\\n\\\"Because prostate cancer grows slowly, those men without symptoms of prostate cancer who do not have a 10-year life expectancy should not be offered testing since they are not likely to benefit,\\\" the society notes on its Web site.\\n\\nAmbivalence over the test hasn't been confined to the United States.\\n\\n\\\"In Europe, we have been reluctant to recommend that all men get PSA testing as we have felt that there has been a lack of knowledge,\\\" agreed lead researcher Dr. Jonas Hugosson, a professor of urology at the University of Gothenburg.\\n\\nHowever, he believes that with the results of the new 14-year study, \\\"it feels ethically difficult not at least to inform all men over the age of 50 about PSA and its possibilities. Personally, I would recommend my friends check their PSA,\\\" Hugosson added.\\n\\nThe report is published in the June 30 online edition of The Lancet Oncology.\\n\\nFor the still-ongoing study, Hugosson randomly assigned some 20,000 men to either PSA screening once every two years or no screening. The men were between 50 and 65 at the start of the study.\\n\\nMen whose PSA levels were above normal were offered more tests, such as a digital rectal exam and prostate biopsies.\\n\\nOver 14 years of follow-up, deaths from prostate cancer dropped by 44 percent among the screened men, compared with unscreened men, the researchers found. Overall, 44 of the men who had PSA testing died from prostate cancer, compared to 78 men who had not had been screened.\\n\\nAmong screened men, 11.4 percent were diagnosed with prostate cancer, compared with 7.2 percent of unscreened men. Of the men in the screened group diagnosed with prostate cancer, nearly 79 percent were diagnosed because they took part in the study, the researchers noted.\\n\\nIn addition, men in the screened group were more likely to have their cancer diagnosed while it was in an early stage. In the screened group, 46 men were diagnosed with advanced cancer, compared with 87 men in the unscreened group, Hugosson's team found.\\n\\n\\\"Our study has a longer follow-up than previous studies, but shows that in those men invited [to the study], the risk of dying is only half of that in the control group. In men younger than 60 at study entry, the effect was even more pronounced -- only one-quarter of expected deaths occurred,\\\" Hugosson said.\\n\\nMoreover, the risk of over-diagnosis was less than previously thought, with just 12 men needed to be diagnosed to save one life. However, since the benefit of PSA screening requires at least 10 years to be borne out, it still seems questionable to test PSA for men over 70, the researchers noted.\\n\\nDr. David E. Neal, a professor of surgical oncology at the University of Cambridge in the U.K. and author of an accompanying editorial, believes that, \\\"PSA testing detects prostate cancer early in its natural history when it causes no symptoms. By doing so, it can save the lives of some men who would otherwise have died of the disease.\\\"\\n\\nThis study adds to previous evidence that PSA testing and screening for prostate cancer saves lives, he said. Still, the PSA test remains \\\"a blunt instrument,\\\" when it comes to determining the aggressiveness of a particular tumor, Neal said. \\\"We need better tests that identify more accurately those men destined to develop problems in the future from this disease,\\\" he said.\\n\\nIn the United States, PSA testing remains a routine part of most physical exams, according to Dr. Nelson Neal Stone, a professor of urology and radiation oncology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City.\\n\\n\\\"I would say 70 to 80 percent of physicians now order a PSA test,\\\" he said. \\\"So it is more or less the standard to care in America to get a PSA done.\\\"\\n\\nStone noted that screening detects a lot of early cancers, which do not need to be treated. \\\"When we see patients with low-risk disease we don't treat them, we observe them,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"Younger men benefit most from screening, because they have the greatest risk of dying,\\\" Stone said. \\\"This study clearly supports PSA screening to prevent prostate cancer deaths.\\\"\\n\\nAnother expert, Dr. Anthony D'Amico, chief of radiation oncology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, added that \\\"people in good health will benefit from [PSA] screening, but people in poor health may not benefit at all.\\\" That's because if their prostate tumor is not aggressive they are more likely to die from the other, more serious conditions, he explained.\\n\\nMore information\\n\\nFor more information on prostate cancer, visit the American Cancer Society.\",\n          \"A daily supplement of pharmaceutical grade chondroitin is as good as celecoxib (Celebrex) at relieving arthritic knee pain and doesn\\u2019t have dangerous side effects, researchers say.\\n\\nDr. Jean-Yves Reginster of Liege State University in Belgium and colleagues recruited 604 people over age 50 with knee osteoarthritis from five European countries and randomly assigned them to take 800 mg of the extra-pure chondroitin sulfate (Chondrosulf), 200 mg of celecoxib (Celebrex) or a placebo every day for six months.\\n\\nThose who took chondroitin sulfate or celecoxib had similar levels of pain relief at the end of the study, and in both groups the improvement was greater than for those taking just a placebo, according to the report in Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases.\\n\\nReginster told Reuters Health the findings are in line with earlier studies showing pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin sulfate could significantly decrease the progression of knee osteoarthritis over a period of three years.\\n\\nHe stressed that pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin is not the same as over-the-counter supplements, which are made differently and can\\u2019t get into the joint in high enough concentrations to combat the causes of cartilage degradation and pain.\\n\\nEuropean regulatory bodies recommend pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin sulfate as well as pharmaceutical-grade glucosamine sulfate as first-line treatments for osteoarthritis, Reginster said by email, because of the side effects associated with celecoxib and other non-steroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including stomach ulcers, bleeding, liver and kidney problems.\\n\\nDr. Michael Shepard of Hoag Orthopedic Institute in Orange, California, noted that the study had a relatively low number of participants and that most U.S. studies of this type would run two years rather than six months.\\n\\nIn addition, U.S.-based studies of chondroitin have had mixed results, said Shepard, who wasn\\u2019t involved in the study. Some have found the supplements to be as effective as ibuprofen (also an NSAID), and some have found that chondroitin sulfate is no more effective than placebo, he told Reuters Health.\\n\\n\\u201cI tell my patients, \\u2018buyer beware,\\u2019\\u201d Shepard said in an email. \\u201cI tell them about the mixed results of chondroitin in the literature. I tell them to try chondroitin for one month as a trial and if they like it and feel better with it, then keep taking it.\\u201d\\n\\nIf chondroitin doesn\\u2019t work for them, he suggests taking an NSAID \\u201cperiodically,\\u201d and to be aware of the side effects.\\n\\n\\u201cIf you are going to stay on an NSAID for a prolonged period then you need regular follow up with your doctor,\\u201d Shepard cautioned.\\n\\nDr. Rachel Wolfe of Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, agreed that chondroitin is \\u201creasonable to try\\u201d for some people, especially those with contraindications to NSAIDs.\\n\\n\\u201cHowever, it should not replace other therapy such as quad strengthening exercises, and weight loss, which we know will provide benefit.

Seaman\\n\\nMelanoma survivors may want to enlist partners to help search their bodies for suspicious looking moles, according to new research.\\n\\nThe researchers previously found that skin cancer survivors and their partners could be trained to spot potentially cancerous moles by doing skin exams. The new report shows that during the two years, those same people had increasing confidence in their skills, with no increase in embarrassment or discomfort.\\n\\n\\u201cThere was concern that they might be embarrassed by examining areas of the body that aren\\u2019t normally seen close up,\\u201d said lead author Dr. June Robinson, of Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.\\n\\nMelanoma survivors were previously told to use mirrors to check inaccessible areas of their bodies, she told Reuters Health.\\n\\n\\u201cFor example, men can\\u2019t see the top of their bald heads or the back of their necks or ears,\\u201d Robinson said.\\n\\nThe new study focused on 395 pairs of melanoma survivors who had received training in skin exams in the original study. The participants attended \\u201cbooster\\u201d training sessions and completed surveys every four months for the next two years.\\n\\nOverall, the trained group found 51 early melanomas during the study, compared to 18 melanomas found by a comparison group of patients and partners who didn\\u2019t receive training.\\n\\nAmong people who received the skin exam training, the researchers found a steep increase in their confidence at performing skin exams between the start of the study and four months later.\\n\\n\\u201cTheir confidence level goes up and plateaus at eight to 12 months, and it doesn\\u2019t go down,\\u201d said Robinson.\\n\\nThe exams didn\\u2019t become more embarrassing or less comfortable, either.\\n\\nThe new results show people can ask friends or relatives to help examine their bodies for suspicious moles, said Robinson.\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s a simple enough statement, and people are not put off by that,\\u201d she said.\\n\\nBringing this program into the mainstream presents some challenges, however. Each person in the study was trained on how to find melanoma and attended booster sessions every four months.\\n\\n\\u201cWe are now trying to see if people can learn, perform and have continuing confidence without the physician reinforcement,\\u201d said Robinson.\\n\\nFor now, she said people can go to the American Academy of Dermatology's website to learn the steps - known as the ABCDEs - of finding melanoma (bit.ly/2h9zl0Y).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 5,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4,\n          2,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"tags\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"criteria\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source_link\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1186,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"http://consumer.Healthday.com/Article.asp?AID=649603\",\n          \"http://articles.Los Angeles Times.com/2011/jan/10/health/la-he-blindness-stem-cells-20110110\",\n          \"http://www.Los Angeles Times.com/health/boostershots/la-heb-prostate-cancer-20110803,0,6012203.story\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"news_source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 41,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"USA Today\",\n          \"FiveThirtyEight\",\n          \"CBSNews.com\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Unfortunately, new research reported Wednesday suggests that there is little women can do other than grin and bear it, since there appear to be no effective treatments.\\n\\nThe pharmaceutical industry once weighed in on the issue heavily, with the result being the introduction of the now-notorious thalidomide, which caused severe birth defects in a large number of infants. That episode led to increased requirements for safety screening of drugs before they are marketed and led to the still-prevalent consensus that it is generally not safe for women to take drugs during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, when morning sickness is at its worst. That has led many women to try alternative treatments, including sugar solutions, ginger, vitamin B6, acupressure and acupuncture. Unfortunately, there is little evidence that any of them are effective, Dr. Anne Matthews of the School of Nursing at Ireland\\u2019s Dublin City University reported Wednesday in the Cochrane Library, a prestigious source of research on the effectiveness of medical treatments.\\n\\nAs many as 85% of pregnant women experience nausea, and half of those endure actual vomiting. The cause is unknown, but researchers suspect hormonal imbalances. About 1 in 200 suffer so severely that they cannot keep any food or liquids down, a condition known as hyperemesis gravidarum. It requires medical treatment and can cause blood clots and damage to the infant. On the plus side, a 2007 study found that women who suffer morning sickness are less likely to develop breast cancer.\\n\\nMatthews and her colleagues reviewed 27 clinical trials involving 4,041 pregnant women who were as much as 20 weeks pregnant. In six studies of acupuncture and two of acupressure -- in which pressure is applied to acupuncture sites rather than needles -- they found no benefit. One study of acustimulation, in which a small electric current is applied through the needles, found some benefit over three weeks. There was also very little evidence to support the benefits of ginger (which actually made many women sick), vitamin B6, antihistamines and anti-vomiting drugs. The anti-vomiting drugs induced sleepiness in recipients.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\u201cA number of the studies we looked at appeared to show benefits, but in general the results were inconsistent and it was difficult to draw firm conclusions about any one treatment in particular,\\u201d Matthews said in a statement. \\u201cWe were also unable to obtain much information about whether these treatments are actually making a difference in women\\u2019s quality of life.\\u201d\\n\\nYour best bet, according to most experts: Get plenty of rest, drink a little at a time but often to prevent dehydration, and eat small servings of bland food such as toast and crackers. Also, avoid strong smells; eating food cold rather than hot can minimize odors that cause nausea.\\n\\n-- Thomas H. Maugh II / Los Angeles Times\",\n          \"You might not want to rush into knee surgery. Physical therapy can be just as good for a common injury and at far less cost and risk, the most rigorous study to compare these treatments concludes.\\n\\nTherapy didn't always help and some people wound up having surgery for the problem, called a torn meniscus. But those who stuck with therapy had improved as much six months and one year later as those who had arthroscopic surgery right away, researchers found.\\n\\n\\\"Both are very good choices. It would be quite reasonable to try physical therapy first because the chances are quite good that you'll do quite well,\\\" said one study leader, Dr. Jeffrey Katz, a joint specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School.\\n\\nHe was to discuss the study Tuesday at an American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons conference in Chicago. Results were published online by the New England Journal of Medicine.\\n\\nA meniscus is one of the crescent-shaped cartilage discs that cushion the knee. About one-third of people over 50 have a tear in one, and arthritis makes this more likely. Usually the tear doesn't cause symptoms but it can be painful.\\n\\nWhen that happens, it's tough to tell if the pain is from the tear or the arthritis \\u2014 or whether surgery is needed or will help. Knee surgery for a torn meniscus is done about half a million times each year in the U.S.\\n\\nThe new federally funded study compared surgery with a less drastic option. Researchers at seven major universities and orthopedic surgery centers around the U.S. assigned 351 people with arthritis and meniscus tears to get either surgery or physical therapy. The therapy was nine sessions on average plus exercises to do at home, which experts say is key to success.\\n\\nAfter six months, both groups had similar rates of functional improvement.

Greenberg, chief of urologic oncology at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, who was not involved with the study.\\n\\n\\\"This is relatively early stage disease, and it shows what we would expect it to show: that those who have more years [to live] have better survival if treated aggressively,\\\" he said.\\n\\nMen with prostate cancer face a confusing maze of options today, including not only surgery but hormone therapy, different kinds of radiation therapy and even simply foregoing medical treatment while monitoring the cancer closely (\\\"watchful waiting,\\\" also known as \\\"active surveillance\\\").\\n\\n\\\"Watchful waiting\\\" is often recommended when a man is not expected to die of the cancer and would like to avoid the risk of the debilitating side effects associated with prostate cancer treatment. These may include: incontinence and erectile dysfunction (surgery); erectile dysfunction and secondary cancers (radiation therapy); nausea, breast growth, liver problems (hormonal therapy); and weakness, hair loss, fluid retention (chemotherapy).\\n\\nThe data presented in the May 5 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine is a 15-year follow-up of a study for which three-years of follow-up had previously been reported.\\n\\nThe earlier study also found that undergoing a radical prostatectomy lowered the risk of the cancer spreading, as well as the death rate from prostate cancer or any other cause.\\n\\nThe researchers, Drs. Anna Bill-Axelson and Lars Holmberg of University Hospital, Uppsala, and colleagues, enrolled nearly 700 men with early prostate cancer under the age of 75 who were randomly selected either to undergo a radical prostatectomy or to stay in \\\"watchful waiting\\\" mode.\\n\\nAfter an average follow-up of about 13 years, 14.6 percent of the men who had undergone surgery had died, versus 20.7 percent in the watchful waiting group, a 38 percent reduced risk.\\n\\nThe benefit was primarily seen among men younger than 65 and the authors estimated that seven men under the age of 65 and 8 over the age of 65 would need to be treated to save one life.\\n\\nThere was also a benefit in men whose tumors had low-risk characteristics.\\n\\nMen whose cancer had moved outside of the prostate gland and who underwent removal of the prostate had a seven times higher risk of dying than men whose tumors hadn't spread.\\n\\nRadical prostatectomy can come with a price -- including erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence and even bowel incontinence -- although these effects are not as common as techniques improve. A nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy, for example, may be able to prevent erectile dysfunction.\\n\\nAlso, the men in this study were diagnosed only after they had symptoms, unlike the majority of men in the United States, Greenberg said.\\n\\n\\\"The advantage of screening is that men are more likely to be cured of cancer but they also have a greater chance of not succumbing to the consequences of the surgical complications, whether [those] be erectile dysfunction or urinary incontinence,\\\" Greenberg said.\\n\\nAlso, he said, erectile dysfunction can also be a factor of aging and can be treated in most cases.\\n\\nBut much remains to be known about how best to treat different types of prostate cancer.\\n\\n\\\"The management of early stage prostate cancer continues to require further randomized controlled studies, which are underway, to determine the true benefit of treatment versus expectant management,\\\" said Dr. Marc Danziger, an attending urologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, who was not involved with the study.\\n\\n\\\"Currently, the potential benefit and side effects of treatment needs to be addressed on an individual basis in relation to the risk stratification of disease, patient desires, health status and risk tolerance,\\\" Danziger added.\\n\\nMore information\\n\\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more on prostate cancer

research reported wednesday suggests that there is little women can do other than grin and bear it since there appear to be no effective treatments the pharmaceutical industry once weighed in on the issue heavily with the result being the introduction of the nownotorious thalidomide which caused severe birth defects in a large number of infants that episode led to increased requirements for safety screening of drugs before they are marketed and led to the stillprevalent consensus that it is generally not safe for women to take drugs during pregnancy especially in the first trimester when morning sickness is at its worst that has led many women to try alternative treatments including sugar solutions ginger vitamin b6 acupressure and acupuncture unfortunately there is little evidence that any of them are effective dr anne matthews of the school of nursing at irelands dublin city university reported wednesday in the cochrane library a prestigious source of research on the effectiveness of medical treatments as many as 85 of pregnant women experience nausea and half of those endure actual vomiting the cause is unknown but researchers suspect hormonal imbalances about 1 in 200 suffer so severely that they cannot keep any food or liquids down a condition known as hyperemesis gravidarum it requires medical treatment and can cause blood clots and damage to the infant on the plus side a 2007 study found that women who suffer morning sickness are less likely to develop breast cancer matthews and her colleagues reviewed 27 clinical trials involving 4041 pregnant women who were as much as 20 weeks pregnant in six studies of acupuncture and two of acupressure in which pressure is applied to acupuncture sites rather than needles they found no benefit one study of acustimulation in which a small electric current is applied through the needles found some benefit over three weeks there was also very little evidence to support the benefits of ginger which actually made many women sick vitamin b6 antihistamines and antivomiting drugs the antivomiting drugs induced sleepiness in recipients advertisement a number of the studies we looked at appeared to show benefits but in general the results were inconsistent and it was difficult to draw firm conclusions about any one treatment in particular matthews said in a statement we were also unable to obtain much information about whether these treatments are actually making a difference in womens quality of life your best bet according to most experts get plenty of rest drink a little at a time but often to prevent dehydration and eat small servings of bland food such as toast and crackers also avoid strong smells eating food cold rather than hot can minimize odors that cause nausea thomas h maugh ii

these treatments concludes therapy didnt always help and some people wound up having surgery for the problem called a torn meniscus but those who stuck with therapy had improved as much six months and one year later as those who had arthroscopic surgery right away researchers found both are very good choices it would be quite reasonable to try physical therapy first because the chances are quite good that youll do quite well said one study leader dr jeffrey katz a joint specialist at brigham and womens hospital and harvard medical school he was to discuss the study tuesday at an american academy of orthopaedic surgeons conference in chicago results were published online by the new england journal of medicine a meniscus is one of the crescentshaped cartilage discs that cushion the knee about onethird of people over 50 have a tear in one and arthritis makes this more likely usually the tear doesnt cause symptoms but it can be painful when that happens its tough to tell if the pain is from the tear or the arthritis or whether surgery is needed or will help knee surgery for a torn meniscus is done about half a million times each year in the us the new federally funded study compared surgery with a less drastic option researchers at seven major universities and orthopedic surgery centers around the us assigned 351 people with arthritis and meniscus tears to get either surgery or

For men at high risk for the disease -- blacks and men who have a father, brother or son found to have prostate cancer at an early age (before 65) -- that discussion should start at age 45.\\n\\n\\\"Because prostate cancer grows slowly, those men without symptoms of prostate cancer who do not have a 10-year life expectancy should not be offered testing since they are not likely to benefit,\\\" the society notes on its Web site.\\n\\nAmbivalence over the test hasn't been confined to the United States.\\n\\n\\\"In Europe, we have been reluctant to recommend that all men get PSA testing as we have felt that there has been a lack of knowledge,\\\" agreed lead researcher Dr. Jonas Hugosson, a professor of urology at the University of Gothenburg.\\n\\nHowever, he believes that with the results of the new 14-year study, \\\"it feels ethically difficult not at least to inform all men over the age of 50 about PSA and its possibilities. Personally, I would recommend my friends check their PSA,\\\" Hugosson added.\\n\\nThe report is published in the June 30 online edition of The Lancet Oncology.\\n\\nFor the still-ongoing study, Hugosson randomly assigned some 20,000 men to either PSA screening once every two years or no screening. The men were between 50 and 65 at the start of the study.\\n\\nMen whose PSA levels were above normal were offered more tests, such as a digital rectal exam and prostate biopsies.\\n\\nOver 14 years of follow-up, deaths from prostate cancer dropped by 44 percent among the screened men, compared with unscreened men, the researchers found. Overall, 44 of the men who had PSA testing died from prostate cancer, compared to 78 men who had not had been screened.\\n\\nAmong screened men, 11.4 percent were diagnosed with prostate cancer, compared with 7.2 percent of unscreened men. Of the men in the screened group diagnosed with prostate cancer, nearly 79 percent were diagnosed because they took part in the study, the researchers noted.\\n\\nIn addition, men in the screened group were more likely to have their cancer diagnosed while it was in an early stage. In the screened group, 46 men were diagnosed with advanced cancer, compared with 87 men in the unscreened group, Hugosson's team found.\\n\\n\\\"Our study has a longer follow-up than previous studies, but shows that in those men invited [to the study], the risk of dying is only half of that in the control group. In men younger than 60 at study entry, the effect was even more pronounced -- only one-quarter of expected deaths occurred,\\\" Hugosson said.\\n\\nMoreover, the risk of over-diagnosis was less than previously thought, with just 12 men needed to be diagnosed to save one life. However, since the benefit of PSA screening requires at least 10 years to be borne out, it still seems questionable to test PSA for men over 70, the researchers noted.\\n\\nDr. David E. Neal, a professor of surgical oncology at the University of Cambridge in the U.K. and author of an accompanying editorial, believes that, \\\"PSA testing detects prostate cancer early in its natural history when it causes no symptoms. By doing so, it can save the lives of some men who would otherwise have died of the disease.\\\"\\n\\nThis study adds to previous evidence that PSA testing and screening for prostate cancer saves lives, he said. Still, the PSA test remains \\\"a blunt instrument,\\\" when it comes to determining the aggressiveness of a particular tumor, Neal said. \\\"We need better tests that identify more accurately those men destined to develop problems in the future from this disease,\\\" he said.\\n\\nIn the United States, PSA testing remains a routine part of most physical exams, according to Dr. Nelson Neal Stone, a professor of urology and radiation oncology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City.\\n\\n\\\"I would say 70 to 80 percent of physicians now order a PSA test,\\\" he said. \\\"So it is more or less the standard to care in America to get a PSA done.\\\"\\n\\nStone noted that screening detects a lot of early cancers, which do not need to be treated. \\\"When we see patients with low-risk disease we don't treat them, we observe them,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"Younger men benefit most from screening, because they have the greatest risk of dying,\\\" Stone said. \\\"This study clearly supports PSA screening to prevent prostate cancer deaths.\\\"\\n\\nAnother expert, Dr. Anthony D'Amico, chief of radiation oncology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, added that \\\"people in good health will benefit from [PSA] screening, but people in poor health may not benefit at all.\\\" That's because if their prostate tumor is not aggressive they are more likely to die from the other, more serious conditions, he explained.\\n\\nMore information\\n\\nFor more information on prostate cancer, visit the American Cancer Society.\",\n          \"A daily supplement of pharmaceutical grade chondroitin is as good as celecoxib (Celebrex) at relieving arthritic knee pain and doesn\\u2019t have dangerous side effects, researchers say.\\n\\nDr. Jean-Yves Reginster of Liege State University in Belgium and colleagues recruited 604 people over age 50 with knee osteoarthritis from five European countries and randomly assigned them to take 800 mg of the extra-pure chondroitin sulfate (Chondrosulf), 200 mg of celecoxib (Celebrex) or a placebo every day for six months.\\n\\nThose who took chondroitin sulfate or celecoxib had similar levels of pain relief at the end of the study, and in both groups the improvement was greater than for those taking just a placebo, according to the report in Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases.\\n\\nReginster told Reuters Health the findings are in line with earlier studies showing pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin sulfate could significantly decrease the progression of knee osteoarthritis over a period of three years.\\n\\nHe stressed that pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin is not the same as over-the-counter supplements, which are made differently and can\\u2019t get into the joint in high enough concentrations to combat the causes of cartilage degradation and pain.\\n\\nEuropean regulatory bodies recommend pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin sulfate as well as pharmaceutical-grade glucosamine sulfate as first-line treatments for osteoarthritis, Reginster said by email, because of the side effects associated with celecoxib and other non-steroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including stomach ulcers, bleeding, liver and kidney problems.\\n\\nDr. Michael Shepard of Hoag Orthopedic Institute in Orange, California, noted that the study had a relatively low number of participants and that most U.S. studies of this type would run two years rather than six months.\\n\\nIn addition, U.S.-based studies of chondroitin have had mixed results, said Shepard, who wasn\\u2019t involved in the study.

It should be used in conjunction with these measures,\\u201d said Wolfe, who wasn\\u2019t involved in the study.\\n\\n\\u201cChondroitin is not a miracle pill, but if it allows people to feel less pain and be more active, thereby losing weight and strengthening muscles, then I think there may benefit,\\u201d Wolfe told Reuters Health by email. \\u201cStudies like this highlight that medicine is still an art - we do not have perfect answers, and we have to individualize for each patient.\\u201d\\n\\nThe study was sponsored by IBSA Institut Biochimique SA, a pharmaceutical company based in Lugano, Switzerland, that makes the chondroitin sulfate supplements used in the test.\\n\\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2rcPLh0 Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, online May 22, 2017.\",\n          \"By Andrew M.

For men at high risk for the disease -- blacks and men who have a father, brother or son found to have prostate cancer at an early age (before 65) -- that discussion should start at age 45.\\n\\n\\\"Because prostate cancer grows slowly, those men without symptoms of prostate cancer who do not have a 10-year life expectancy should not be offered testing since they are not likely to benefit,\\\" the society notes on its Web site.\\n\\nAmbivalence over the test hasn't been confined to the United States.\\n\\n\\\"In Europe, we have been reluctant to recommend that all men get PSA testing as we have felt that there has been a lack of knowledge,\\\" agreed lead researcher Dr. Jonas Hugosson, a professor of urology at the University of Gothenburg.\\n\\nHowever, he believes that with the results of the new 14-year study, \\\"it feels ethically difficult not at least to inform all men over the age of 50 about PSA and its possibilities. Personally, I would recommend my friends check their PSA,\\\" Hugosson added.\\n\\nThe report is published in the June 30 online edition of The Lancet Oncology.\\n\\nFor the still-ongoing study, Hugosson randomly assigned some 20,000 men to either PSA screening once every two years or no screening. The men were between 50 and 65 at the start of the study.\\n\\nMen whose PSA levels were above normal were offered more tests, such as a digital rectal exam and prostate biopsies.\\n\\nOver 14 years of follow-up, deaths from prostate cancer dropped by 44 percent among the screened men, compared with unscreened men, the researchers found. Overall, 44 of the men who had PSA testing died from prostate cancer, compared to 78 men who had not had been screened.\\n\\nAmong screened men, 11.4 percent were diagnosed with prostate cancer, compared with 7.2 percent of unscreened men. Of the men in the screened group diagnosed with prostate cancer, nearly 79 percent were diagnosed because they took part in the study, the researchers noted.\\n\\nIn addition, men in the screened group were more likely to have their cancer diagnosed while it was in an early stage. In the screened group, 46 men were diagnosed with advanced cancer, compared with 87 men in the unscreened group, Hugosson's team found.\\n\\n\\\"Our study has a longer follow-up than previous studies, but shows that in those men invited [to the study], the risk of dying is only half of that in the control group. In men younger than 60 at study entry, the effect was even more pronounced -- only one-quarter of expected deaths occurred,\\\" Hugosson said.\\n\\nMoreover, the risk of over-diagnosis was less than previously thought, with just 12 men needed to be diagnosed to save one life. However, since the benefit of PSA screening requires at least 10 years to be borne out, it still seems questionable to test PSA for men over 70, the researchers noted.\\n\\nDr. David E. Neal, a professor of surgical oncology at the University of Cambridge in the U.K. and author of an accompanying editorial, believes that, \\\"PSA testing detects prostate cancer early in its natural history when it causes no symptoms. By doing so, it can save the lives of some men who would otherwise have died of the disease.\\\"\\n\\nThis study adds to previous evidence that PSA testing and screening for prostate cancer saves lives, he said. Still, the PSA test remains \\\"a blunt instrument,\\\" when it comes to determining the aggressiveness of a particular tumor, Neal said. \\\"We need better tests that identify more accurately those men destined to develop problems in the future from this disease,\\\" he said.\\n\\nIn the United States, PSA testing remains a routine part of most physical exams, according to Dr. Nelson Neal Stone, a professor of urology and radiation oncology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City.\\n\\n\\\"I would say 70 to 80 percent of physicians now order a PSA test,\\\" he said. \\\"So it is more or less the standard to care in America to get a PSA done.\\\"\\n\\nStone noted that screening detects a lot of early cancers, which do not need to be treated. \\\"When we see patients with low-risk disease we don't treat them, we observe them,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"Younger men benefit most from screening, because they have the greatest risk of dying,\\\" Stone said. \\\"This study clearly supports PSA screening to prevent prostate cancer deaths.\\\"\\n\\nAnother expert, Dr. Anthony D'Amico, chief of radiation oncology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, added that \\\"people in good health will benefit from [PSA] screening, but people in poor health may not benefit at all.\\\" That's because if their prostate tumor is not aggressive they are more likely to die from the other, more serious conditions, he explained.\\n\\nMore information\\n\\nFor more information on prostate cancer, visit the American Cancer Society.\",\n          \"A daily supplement of pharmaceutical grade chondroitin is as good as celecoxib (Celebrex) at relieving arthritic knee pain and doesn\\u2019t have dangerous side effects, researchers say.\\n\\nDr. Jean-Yves Reginster of Liege State University in Belgium and colleagues recruited 604 people over age 50 with knee osteoarthritis from five European countries and randomly assigned them to take 800 mg of the extra-pure chondroitin sulfate (Chondrosulf), 200 mg of celecoxib (Celebrex) or a placebo every day for six months.\\n\\nThose who took chondroitin sulfate or celecoxib had similar levels of pain relief at the end of the study, and in both groups the improvement was greater than for those taking just a placebo, according to the report in Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases.\\n\\nReginster told Reuters Health the findings are in line with earlier studies showing pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin sulfate could significantly decrease the progression of knee osteoarthritis over a period of three years.\\n\\nHe stressed that pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin is not the same as over-the-counter supplements, which are made differently and can\\u2019t get into the joint in high enough concentrations to combat the causes of cartilage degradation and pain.\\n\\nEuropean regulatory bodies recommend pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin sulfate as well as pharmaceutical-grade glucosamine sulfate as first-line treatments for osteoarthritis, Reginster said by email, because of the side effects associated with celecoxib and other non-steroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including stomach ulcers, bleeding, liver and kidney problems.\\n\\nDr. Michael Shepard of Hoag Orthopedic Institute in Orange, California, noted that the study had a relatively low number of participants and that most U.S. studies of this type would run two years rather than six months.\\n\\nIn addition, U.S.-based studies of chondroitin have had mixed results, said Shepard, who wasn\\u2019t involved in the study. Some have found the supplements to be as effective as ibuprofen (also an NSAID), and some have found that chondroitin sulfate is no more effective than placebo, he told Reuters Health.\\n\\n\\u201cI tell my patients, \\u2018buyer beware,\\u2019\\u201d Shepard said in an email. \\u201cI tell them about the mixed results of chondroitin in the literature. I tell them to try chondroitin for one month as a trial and if they like it and feel better with it, then keep taking it.\\u201d\\n\\nIf chondroitin doesn\\u2019t work for them, he suggests taking an NSAID \\u201cperiodically,\\u201d and to be aware of the side effects.\\n\\n\\u201cIf you are going to stay on an NSAID for a prolonged period then you need regular follow up with your doctor,\\u201d Shepard cautioned.\\n\\nDr. Rachel Wolfe of Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, agreed that chondroitin is \\u201creasonable to try\\u201d for some people, especially those with contraindications to NSAIDs.\\n\\n\\u201cHowever, it should not replace other therapy such as quad strengthening exercises, and weight loss, which we know will provide benefit. It should be used in conjunction with these measures,\\u201d said Wolfe, who wasn\\u2019t involved in the study.\\n\\n\\u201cChondroitin is not a miracle pill, but if it allows people to feel less pain and be more active, thereby losing weight and strengthening muscles, then I think there may benefit,\\u201d Wolfe told Reuters Health by email. \\u201cStudies like this highlight that medicine is still an art - we do not have perfect answers, and we have to individualize for each patient.\\u201d\\n\\nThe study was sponsored by IBSA Institut Biochimique SA, a pharmaceutical company based in Lugano, Switzerland, that makes the chondroitin sulfate supplements used in the test.\\n\\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2rcPLh0 Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, online May 22, 2017.\",\n          \"By Andrew M. Seaman\\n\\nMelanoma survivors may want to enlist partners to help search their bodies for suspicious looking moles, according to new research.\\n\\nThe researchers previously found that skin cancer survivors and their partners could be trained to spot potentially cancerous moles by doing skin exams. The new report shows that during the two years, those same people had increasing confidence in their skills, with no increase in embarrassment or discomfort.\\n\\n\\u201cThere was concern that they might be embarrassed by examining areas of the body that aren\\u2019t normally seen close up,\\u201d said lead author Dr. June Robinson, of Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.\\n\\nMelanoma survivors were previously told to use mirrors to check inaccessible areas of their bodies, she told Reuters Health.\\n\\n\\u201cFor example, men can\\u2019t see the top of their bald heads or the back of their necks or ears,\\u201d Robinson said.\\n\\nThe new study focused on 395 pairs of melanoma survivors who had received training in skin exams in the original study. The participants attended \\u201cbooster\\u201d training sessions and completed surveys every four months for the next two years.\\n\\nOverall, the trained group found 51 early melanomas during the study, compared to 18 melanomas found by a comparison group of patients and partners who didn\\u2019t receive training.\\n\\nAmong people who received the skin exam training, the researchers found a steep increase in their confidence at performing skin exams between the start of the study and four months later.\\n\\n\\u201cTheir confidence level goes up and plateaus at eight to 12 months, and it doesn\\u2019t go down,\\u201d said Robinson.\\n\\nThe exams didn\\u2019t become more embarrassing or less comfortable, either.\\n\\nThe new results show people can ask friends or relatives to help examine their bodies for suspicious moles, said Robinson.\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s a simple enough statement, and people are not put off by that,\\u201d she said.\\n\\nBringing this program into the mainstream presents some challenges, however. Each person in the study was trained on how to find melanoma and attended booster sessions every four months.\\n\\n\\u201cWe are now trying to see if people can learn, perform and have continuing

ongoing debate on the usefulness of the prostatespecific antigen psa blood test for prostate cancer new research from sweden finds the screen cuts lives lost to the disease by almost half the argument over whether psa screening saves mens lives or merely leads to the overdiagnosis of very slowgrowing cancers with attendant worry and overtreatment has bedeviled the medical world for years according to recently revised guidelines from the american cancer society men at average risk for prostate cancer should discuss the psa test with their doctor starting at age 50 for men at high risk for the disease blacks and men who have a father brother or son found to have prostate cancer at an early age before 65 that discussion should start at age 45 because prostate cancer grows slowly those men without symptoms of prostate cancer who do not have a 10year life expectancy should not be offered testing since they are not likely to benefit the society notes on its web site ambivalence over the test hasnt been confined to the united states in europe we have been reluctant to recommend that all men get psa testing as we have felt that there has been a lack of knowledge agreed lead researcher dr jonas hugosson a professor of urology at the university of gothenburg however he believes that with the results of the new 14year study it feels ethically difficult not at least to inform all men over the age of 50 about psa and its possibilities personally i would recommend my friends check their psa hugosson added the report is published in the june 30 online edition of the lancet oncology for the stillongoing study hugosson randomly assigned some 20000 men to either psa screening once every two years or no screening the men were between 50 and 65 at the start of the study men whose psa levels were above normal were offered more tests such as a digital rectal exam and prostate biopsies over 14 years of followup deaths from prostate cancer dropped by 44 percent among the screened men compared with unscreened men the researchers found overall 44 of the men who had psa testing died from prostate cancer compared to 78 men who had not had been screened among screened men 114 percent were diagnosed with prostate cancer compared with 72 percent of unscreened men of the men in the screened group diagnosed with prostate cancer nearly 79 percent were diagnosed because they took part in the study the researchers noted in addition men in the screened group were more likely to have their cancer diagnosed while it was in an early stage in the screened group 46 men were diagnosed with advanced cancer compared with 87 men in the unscreened group hugossons team found our study has a longer followup than previous studies but shows that in those men invited to the study the risk of dying is only half of that in the control group in men younger than 60 at study entry the effect was even more pronounced only onequarter of expected deaths occurred hugosson said moreover the risk of overdiagnosis was less than previously thought with just 12 men needed to be diagnosed to save one life however since the benefit of psa screening requires at least 10 years to be borne out it still seems questionable to test psa for men over 70 the researchers noted dr david e neal a professor of surgical oncology at the university of cambridge in the uk and author of an accompanying editorial believes that psa testing detects prostate cancer early in its natural history when it causes no symptoms by doing so it can save the lives of some men who would otherwise have died of the disease this study adds to previous evidence that psa testing and screening for prostate cancer saves lives he said still the psa test remains a blunt instrument when it comes to determining the aggressiveness of a particular tumor neal said we need better tests that identify more accurately those men destined to develop problems in the future from this disease he said in the united states psa testing remains a routine part of most physical exams according to dr nelson neal stone a professor of urology and radiation oncology at the mount sinai school of medicine in new york city i would say 70 to 80 percent of physicians now order a psa test he said so it is more or less the standard to care in america to get a psa done stone noted that screening detects a lot of early cancers which do not need to be treated when we see patients with lowrisk disease we dont treat them we observe them he said younger men benefit most from screening because they have the greatest risk of dying stone said this study clearly supports psa screening to prevent prostate cancer deaths another expert dr anthony damico chief of radiation oncology at brigham and womens hospital in boston added that people in good health will benefit from psa screening but people in poor health may not benefit at all thats because if their prostate tumor is not aggressive they are more likely to die from the other more serious conditions he explained more information for more information on prostate cancer visit the american cancer society\",\n          \"a daily supplement of pharmaceutical grade chondroitin is as good as celecoxib celebrex at relieving arthritic knee pain and doesnt have dangerous side effects researchers say dr jeanyves reginster of liege state university in belgium and colleagues recruited 604 people over age 50 with knee osteoarthritis from five european countries and randomly assigned them to take 800 mg of the extrapure chondroitin sulfate chondrosulf 200 mg of celecoxib celebrex or a placebo every day for six months those who took chondroitin sulfate or celecoxib had similar levels of pain relief at the end of the study and in both groups the improvement was greater than for those taking just a placebo according to the report in annals of the rheumatic diseases reginster told reuters health the findings are in line with earlier studies showing pharmaceuticalgrade chondroitin sulfate could significantly decrease the progression of knee osteoarthritis over a period of three years he stressed that pharmaceuticalgrade chondroitin is not the same as overthecounter supplements which are made differently and cant get into the joint in high enough concentrations to combat the causes of cartilage degradation and pain european regulatory bodies recommend pharmaceuticalgrade chondroitin sulfate as well as pharmaceuticalgrade glucosamine sulfate as firstline treatments for osteoarthritis reginster said by email because of the side effects associated with celecoxib and other nonsteroidal inflammatory drugs nsaids including stomach ulcers bleeding liver and kidney problems dr michael shepard of hoag orthopedic institute in orange california noted that the study had a relatively low number of participants and that most us studies of this type would run two years rather than six months in addition usbased studies of chondroitin have had mixed results said shepard who wasnt involved in the study some have found the supplements to be as effective as ibuprofen also an nsaid and some have found that chondroitin sulfate is no more effective than placebo he told reuters health i tell my patients buyer beware shepard said in an email i tell them about the mixed results of chondroitin in the literature i tell them to try chondroitin for one month as a trial and if they like it and feel better with it then keep taking it if chondroitin doesnt work for them he suggests taking an nsaid periodically and to be aware of the side effects if you are going to stay on an nsaid for a prolonged period then you need regular follow up with your doctor shepard cautioned dr rachel wolfe of wake forest baptist medical center in winstonsalem north carolina agreed that chondroitin is reasonable to try for some people especially those with contraindications to nsaids however it should not replace other therapy such as quad strengthening exercises and weight loss which we know will provide benefit it should be used in conjunction with these measures said wolfe who wasnt involved in the study chondroitin is not a miracle pill but if it allows people to feel less pain and be more active thereby losing weight and strengthening muscles then i think there may benefit wolfe told reuters health by email studies like this highlight that medicine is still an art we do not have perfect answers and we have to individualize for each patient the study was sponsored by ibsa institut biochimique sa a pharmaceutical company based in lugano switzerland that makes the chondroitin sulfate supplements used in the test source bitly2rcplh0 annals of the rheumatic diseases online may 22 2017\",\n          \"by andrew m seaman melanoma survivors may want to enlist partners to help search their bodies for suspicious looking moles according to new research the researchers previously found that skin cancer survivors and their partners could be trained to spot potentially cancerous moles by doing skin exams the new report shows that during the two years those same people had increasing confidence in their skills with no increase in embarrassment or discomfort there was concern that they might be embarrassed by examining areas of the body that arent normally seen close up said lead author dr june robinson of northwestern university feinberg school of medicine in chicago melanoma survivors were previously told to use mirrors to check inaccessible areas of their bodies she told reuters health for example men cant see the top of their bald heads or the back of their necks or ears robinson said the new study focused on 395 pairs of melanoma survivors who had received training in skin exams in the original study the participants attended booster training sessions and completed surveys every four months for the next two years overall the trained group found 51 early melanomas during the study compared to 18 melanomas found by a comparison group of patients and partners who didnt receive training among people who received the skin exam training the researchers found a steep increase in their confidence at performing skin exams between the start of the study and four months later their confidence level goes up and plateaus at eight to 12 months and it doesnt go down said robinson the exams didnt become more embarrassing or less comfortable either the new results show people can ask friends or relatives to help examine their bodies for suspicious moles said robinson thats a simple enough statement and people are not put off by that she said bringing this program into the mainstream presents some challenges however each person in the study was trained on how to find melanoma and attended booster sessions every four months we are now trying to see if people can learn perform and have continuing confidence without the physician reinforcement said robinson for now she said people can go to the american academy of dermatologys website to learn the steps known as the abcdes of finding melanoma bitly2h9zl0y\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n
